# React Project for the React Course

The application is a Todo project that allows you create, read, update, delete todos:

https://todo-v2-2023.vercel.app/

Sample:

![todo](https://github.com/LysenkoDenys/Todo-v2-2023-07-15/assets/105970854/9a71553b-0f48-47a2-a652-2efbaee2242d)

This React JS project uses next API: ‚≠êhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid to generate unic id.
Build with CSS modules.

also fixed some issues from original course:
then text in todo item is too long we need to apply this into appropriate css module
.item {
overflow: hidden;
text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
also added capability to save TO-DOs into localStorage

hope next generation will extend this project to:

1. re-arrange tasks.
2. rewrite text inside task.
3. confirmation modal window to confirm refresh all the tasks.

and it have been extended:
